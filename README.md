# SocioLive Core Standalone
A standalone version of SocioLive that is completely offline and runs on a simple index.html file. 


### Socio Labs Summer 2017 Take Home Assignment

#### Introduction

Here at [Socio](https://socio.events), one of our simplest but most engaging products is the SocioLive and its Attendee Drawing Feature. Our customers use SocioLive to visualize the engagement that is going on during their event. The attendee drawing serves as their tool to administer giveaways throughout or at the conclusion of said event. To see SocioLive in action simply click [here](https://socio.live). And by hovering your mouse to that magic wand on the left top corner you can start the Attendee Drawing. The numbers that are changing show the number of attendees that have joined the event, as well as, how many people have made connections (handshakes) with each other, and the leading industries shows the industry making the most connections! 

Currently, those names in this demo Attendee Drawing are hardcoded in the Javascript code `js/live-demo.js`. One of the most frequent requests that we receive from our customers is to have the ability to upload names to our Attendee Drawing through a csv (comma-separated values) file. As your take home assignment, you will simply be given this task. You will need to somehow let our customer upload a csv file into Attendee Drawing. You will be responsible for designing the front-end and back-end of it through HTML and Javascript or anything that can run in a browser.

Here you can see an example csv file that our customers will be able to use to upload names into the Attendee Drawing. You will be given the current source code that we have, but we would like to keep this assignment open ended, so feel free to rewrite the entire Attendee Drawing through a language of your convenience ([ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) would be one that we would be interesting to see, but plain old Javascript or [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) is also good). If you decide to not use the code provided and rewrite, you do NOT need recreate any of the other parts of SocioLive, just the attendee drawing. Ultimately, this project is entirely yours, so think of this project as something that we would publish to thousands of people to use. 

P.S. If you come up with something solid, we will publish it and thousands of people will enjoy using your creation! We recommended keeping this work you create in your public profile for other people to see. We love open source and we love collaborating!
